# CSC-300-Assignment-2

Write a program, using method overloading, to add two user inputs of the same type. User will not
specify the data type, so the data needs to be read as String. Once the data is read, check to identify the
type of the data i.e., int, double or String. After the data type is identified, convert the String into the
appropriate type if required, and then call the method to perform the addition. In case of Strings, the result
is the concatenated String. You need to write your own methods for this assignment; no library methods
are allowed, except for using the Scanner and associated methods for reading input.
Sample executions of program:


1. Enter two values: 123 456
The sum is: 579

2. Enter two values: 12.5 20.1
The sum is: 32.6

3. Enter two values: abc def
The sum is: abcdef

4. Enter two values: 123.456.789 4.5.6
The sum is: 123.456.7894.5.6
